# Test Driven Detective

Train the Test Driven Detective in Test Driven Deduction using Test Driven Development.

## First Task

Run the tests, you'll find several cases set out already, but the detective can't `solve()` them!  

Add `solve()` to the detective, you should be able to solve the first three cases without touching any other file.

## Second Task

Add a `Witness` class to help the detective out, the Witness should be able to take a list of arguments to describe what they saw.

This task will require you to refactor more than just the detective, you may even need to refactor the tests. 

## Third Task

Make the crimes tougher, the detective smarter.

Add your own unique twist.
